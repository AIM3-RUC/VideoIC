This is the page for the Danmuku research of AIM3 Lab.



## Danmuku
Live video commenting, commonly known as "danmaku" or "bullet screen", is an emerging feature on online video sites, which allows viewers to post real-time comments anonymously to fly across the screen like bullets.

Danmaku have some unique interactive features:
(1) Pin to specific moment of video.
(2) Involve rich multimodal information interaction.
(3) Present a group chatting scenario which contains various interaction forms among viewers.
